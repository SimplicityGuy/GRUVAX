# Phase 6: LED Contract over MQTT (Hardware Stubbed) - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-05-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Every kiosk highlight publishes a versioned, Pydantic-validated MQTT payload to an
**internal-only** Mosquitto broker (no host port exposure), the admin can tune LED
colors and brightness, and "all off" + a diagnostic sequence work end-to-end — so the
contract is hardware-ready without any firmware existing yet.

**In scope:** LED-01..LED-10, DEP-03. The publish path (`mqtt/publishers.py`), a
`POST /api/illuminate` endpoint, admin LED color/brightness settings + a "LEDs" section
in the existing admin Settings page, an "All off" button, a diagnostic endpoint, and the
retained-state / topic-versioning / expiry plumbing.

**Out of scope (future hardware milestone, do NOT build here):** real ESP32/WS2812B
firmware, broker host-port exposure, per-device-class MQTT credentials, a second LAN
listener, TLS. The broker stays internal to the Compose network; nobody subscribes in v1.

## Implementation Decisions

### Publish seam & hot-path isolation
- **D-01:** A kiosk select triggers a **`POST /api/illuminate`** call — a separate request
  the kiosk makes *after* `/api/locate`. `/api/locate` stays a pure CPU-only read with no
  side effects so its ≤50 ms budget is untouched. The publish is fire-and-forget with a
  **~250 ms timeout** (SC5) off the request hot path; a broker hiccup never blocks the API
  (mirror the existing degraded-mode stub posture).
- **D-02:** The layered command (LED-09) is **one `POST /api/illuminate` request that the
  server fans out** to the three locked topics — `illuminate/{u}/{r}/{c}`,
  `span/{change_id}`, and `sub/{u}/{r}/{c}`. No new composite topic; the locked
  ARCHITECTURE topic tree is authoritative.
- **D-03:** The request body is the **`LocateResult` the kiosk already holds** from its
  preceding `/api/locate` call (primary_cube, label_span, sub_cube_interval). The server
  validates it against the contract, then resolves colors/brightness/expiry and publishes.
  No server-side re-locate. (LAN-only, single-user, `/api/illuminate` is unauthenticated
  per ARCHITECTURE — trusting the client-provided result is acceptable here, but the
  payload MUST still pass the Pydantic `LocateResult` shape.)

### LED palette & color configuration
- **D-04:** **LED colors are a SEPARATE palette from the kiosk UI.** The kiosk grid keeps
  the Nordic Grid design language untouched (lit cell = yellow + LED glow). Physical LEDs
  get their own admin-tunable palette. This deliberately resolves the design-language
  ("lit cells always yellow") vs Pitfall 18 ("gold primary / purple span") tension — they
  are two distinct output surfaces, not one shared palette.
- **D-05:** The admin gets a **free per-state color picker** (label-span, position, error,
  setup, all-off — LED-05), **seeded with color-blind-safe defaults** (primary/position
  gold `#FFD700`, label-span purple `#7C3AED` per Pitfall 18) and offering **Nordic Grid
  design-token swatches as presets**, but custom hex is allowed.
- **D-06:** Color is encoded as **resolved `{r,g,b}` in the payload, server-side** from the
  configured settings. Firmware stays dumb; admin color changes take effect with no
  firmware update. (ARCHITECTURE default; the `color_name`-resolved-by-firmware variant is
  rejected.)
- **D-07:** **Two brightness ceilings** (LED-04): ambient (label-span) ~30–50% and active
  (position) 100%. The **server clamps every payload's brightness** to the relevant
  ceiling so nothing exceeds it. Brightness-as-information (Pitfall 18): span stays dimmer
  than primary even for a viewer who can't perceive hue.

### Diagnostic & all-off
- **D-08:** The diagnostic endpoint (LED-07) runs as a **background task that returns a
  `run_id` immediately**; the admin UI gets an instant ack and the sequence publishes
  cube-by-cube in the background, logging each publish.
- **D-09:** The diagnostic **cycles every cube, one at a time, through the configured state
  colors** (label-span → position → error → setup → off). This exercises the full color
  contract + every topic and is verifiable via `mosquitto_sub` even with no hardware.
- **D-10:** "Log any status responses" (LED-07): during the diagnostic run, **transiently
  subscribe to `gruvax/v1/leds/status/#`**, log whatever arrives (expected: nothing in
  v1), then time out. This wires the future hardware status-listening seam now so the
  hardware milestone works without an API change.
- **D-11:** "All off" (LED-06) is **idempotent**: publish an empty retained payload
  (`payload=b''`, `retain=True`) to **every** `state/{u}/{r}/{c}` topic (the Pitfall 3
  clear-retained idiom) AND publish a command on `.../all/off`. Safe to call repeatedly;
  clears retained ghosts.

### Retained-state hygiene, topics & settings
- **D-12:** Every retained `state/*` publish sets **MQTT 5 `message_expiry_interval` = 4h
  by default**, overridable via setting/env. The broker auto-drops stale retained payloads
  (Pitfall 3). "No expiry" is rejected.
- **D-13:** The **v1 stub DOES publish retained `state/*`** topics (with no hardware
  listening). ARCHITECTURE: "costs nothing" and lets the hardware milestone work
  end-to-end with no later contract change. Each illuminate also writes the retained
  desired-state for the affected cube(s).
- **D-14:** Topics are environment-separated via a configurable **`MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX`** —
  `gruvax/v1/dev/leds/...` in dev, `gruvax/v1/leds/...` in prod (Pitfall 3). Dev retained
  junk never pollutes prod topics.
- **D-15:** Settings are split by precedence: **topology/connection knobs** (MQTT host,
  creds, `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX`, default expiry) live in `settings.py`/env; **presentation
  knobs** (per-state colors, the two brightness ceilings, transition defaults) live in the
  `gruvax.settings` DB table (admin-editable via the settings cache + `Settings.tsx`). The
  admin can tune the look but cannot break broker connectivity.

### Transitions & admin LED UI
- **D-16:** LED-10 transitions use **per-state defaults**: primary/position = `pulse`,
  label-span = `fade`, all-off = `instant`. Declared in the payload's
  `transition: {style, duration_ms}`. Motion is an information channel (Pitfall 18) so a
  color-blind viewer still distinguishes primary from span.
- **D-17:** Transitions are **fixed sensible defaults in v1, with the payload field +
  settings schema supporting overrides**, but **no transition editor UI** is built —
  transitions only become observable once firmware exists, so editing a stubbed-only effect
  adds UI for no payoff.
- **D-18:** Build a **lightweight color-blind preview now** (deuteranopia / protanopia /
  tritanopia matrix simulation) next to the color picker. The moment the admin picks colors
  is the one place Pitfall 18 prevention works; without it, the seeded safe defaults can be
  overridden into an inaccessible pair.
- **D-19:** The admin LED control surface is a **new "LEDs" section inside the existing
  `Settings.tsx`** (color swatches + brightness sliders + All-off + Diagnostic buttons) —
  **no new route**. Phase 6 has no roadmap "UI hint"; this is a settings-shaped concern
  that reuses the Settings shell + settings cache.

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact Pydantic model layout for the per-topic payload schemas (`gruvax.illuminate.v1`,
  `gruvax.sub_interval.v1`, span) — follow the JSON shapes locked in ARCHITECTURE
  §"Payload format"; the documented schema must live alongside the contract in the repo
  (SC4).
- QoS per topic is already locked by ARCHITECTURE (illuminate/span/sub = QoS 0; all/off +
  diagnostic = QoS 1; state/* = QoS 1 retained) — apply as specified.
- Inter-cube delay / total duration of the diagnostic sequence (pick a documented,
  reasonable cadence).
- The default transition `duration_ms` values per state.
- Settings-cache key naming under `gruvax.settings` (follow the existing
  `led_color.*` / `led_brightness.*` convention hinted in ARCHITECTURE §schema).

## Canonical References

**Downstream agents MUST read these before planning or implementing.**

### Locked MQTT contract (authoritative)
- `.planning/research/ARCHITECTURE.md` §"MQTT Topic Design" (topic tree, JSON payload
  format, retain vs non-retain, QoS levels, v1-stub-vs-hardware table, home-LAN-only
  enforcement) — the single source of truth for topics, payload shapes, and semantics.
- `.planning/research/ARCHITECTURE.md` §"API surface" (the `POST /api/illuminate`,
  `POST /api/admin/leds/diagnostic`, `POST /api/admin/leds/off` row definitions).

### Pitfalls that drive decisions
- `.planning/research/PITFALLS.md` §"Pitfall 3" — retained-state lifecycle: message-expiry
  on every retained publish, all-off clears retained via empty payload, per-env topic
  prefix. (Drives D-11, D-12, D-13, D-14.)
- `.planning/research/PITFALLS.md` §"Pitfall 18" — color-blind-safe defaults, brightness
  as a second information channel, color-blind preview in the picker, motion to
  distinguish primary from span. (Drives D-04, D-05, D-07, D-16, D-18.)

### Requirements & scope
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` §"LED Control Surface" (LED-01..LED-10) + §"Deployment"
  (DEP-03).
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` §"Phase 6" (the five success criteria — these are effectively a
  locked acceptance spec for this phase).

### Design language (LED palette + admin picker)
- `design/gruvax-design-language.md` — the Nordic Grid spec; note the kiosk UI keeps it
  unchanged (D-04). LED palette is separate but the picker offers token swatches as presets.
- `design/gruvax-design-tokens.css`, `design/gruvax-design-tokens.json` — token source for
  the preset swatches.

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- `src/gruvax/mqtt/client.py` — existing Phase 1 MQTT stub: best-effort connect at
  lifespan startup, retained `gruvax/v1/server/hello`, LWT configured, fully non-blocking
  (degraded mode: `app.state.mqtt = None`, `app.state.mqtt_ok = False`). The connected
  `aiomqtt.Client` lives at `app.state.mqtt`. **No publish path yet** — its own comment
  points to a future `mqtt/publishers.py` (the comment says "Phase 5" but LED was
  renumbered to Phase 6; the publish path genuinely does not exist).
- `src/gruvax/estimator/contract.py` — `LocateResult` (+ `SubInterval`). The illuminate
  request body reuses this; the publishers map it to the per-topic payloads.
- `src/gruvax/db/queries.py` — `load_settings_cache()` loads `gruvax.settings` key/value
  rows into `app.state.settings_cache` at startup; LED colors/brightness/transitions live
  here as presentation settings (D-15).
- `src/gruvax/api/admin/settings.py` + `frontend/src/routes/admin/Settings.tsx` — the
  admin settings router + page to extend with the new "LEDs" section (D-19). Frontend
  helpers available: `el()` DOM helper (`frontend/src/lib/dom.ts`), `adminClient`
  (`frontend/src/api/client.ts`), NumericKeypad, FillBar, SegmentLegend.

### Established Patterns
- **MQTT non-blocking / degraded posture** (`mqtt/client.py`): never let broker
  unavailability block startup or a request. The publish wrapper inherits this — wrap
  publishes in a ~250 ms timeout and swallow/log failures (D-01).
- **aiomqtt client held via `__aenter__()`/`__aexit__()`** directly (not `async with`) so
  the client reference survives in `app.state.mqtt`.
- **Settings precedence split** already exists: `settings.py`/env for infra
  (DATABASE_URL, MQTT_*), `gruvax.settings` DB for runtime-tunable values — D-15 follows it.
- **Admin routes require session + CSRF** (Phase 3 `require_admin`); the diagnostic and
  all-off endpoints are admin-gated; `POST /api/illuminate` is public (kiosk, no auth) per
  ARCHITECTURE.
- **Compose / Mosquitto already conforms to DEP-03**: `compose.yaml` runs
  `eclipse-mosquitto` with **no host `ports:`**, a persistence volume
  (`mosquitto-data`), a healthcheck, and `mosquitto/mosquitto.conf` mounted. Persistence is
  on; this phase only adds the expiry/prefix semantics, not new topology.

### Integration Points
- New `src/gruvax/mqtt/publishers.py` (illuminate/span/sub/state/all-off/diagnostic
  payload builders + publish wrapper) — consumes `app.state.mqtt`, `settings_cache`
  (colors/brightness/transitions), and `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX`/expiry from `settings.py`.
- New `POST /api/illuminate` route (public) accepting a `LocateResult`.
- New admin LED routes: `POST /api/admin/leds/diagnostic`, `POST /api/admin/leds/off`
  (session + CSRF), plus settings read/write for the LED keys.
- `settings.py`: add `MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX` and a default `message_expiry_interval` knob.
- `gruvax.settings` seed: LED color/brightness/transition defaults (color-blind-safe).
- `src/gruvax/api/health.py` already reports `mqtt` status — no change needed beyond
  keeping the degraded-mode contract intact.

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- LED palette defaults are explicitly the Pitfall 18 pair: **primary/position gold
  `#FFD700`**, **label-span purple `#7C3AED`** — high luminance contrast + distinct hue
  under all common color-blindness types.
- Brightness conveys importance even without hue: **span dim (~30–50%), primary full
  (100%)**.
- Motion conveys importance even without hue: **primary pulses, span fades, all-off
  instant.**
- The diagnostic must be meaningful with zero hardware: prove it via
  `mosquitto_sub -t 'gruvax/v1/dev/leds/#' -v`.
</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- **Real LED firmware (ESP32/WS2812B), broker host-port exposure, second LAN listener,
  per-device credentials, TLS** — future hardware milestone (already PROJECT.md out-of-scope).
- **Transition editor UI** — schema/payload support ships now (D-17), but the admin editing
  surface waits until firmware makes transitions observable.
- **Firmware-published status consumption beyond logging** — the diagnostic subscribes to
  `status/#` and logs (D-10); acting on status is a hardware-milestone concern.

None of the discussion strayed outside the phase domain.
